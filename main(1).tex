\maketitle
\section{Introduction}
Introduce the nearest neighbor problem and the approaches that you will be using to solve it. Provide a figure showing an example of the problem. 

\section{Algorithms}
\subsection{Brute Force Algorithm}
Describe your brute force algorithm. Include a figure illustrating how the algorithm works. 
\subsubsection*{Run-time}
Discuss the theoretical run time.

\subsection{Divide and Conquer Algorithm}
Describe your divide and conquer algorithm. Include a figure illustrating how the algorithm starts (you don't need to show any recursive calls, but you can if you would like).
\subsubsection*{Run-time}
Discuss the theoretical run time.

\section{Results}
Include a table comparing the results on the provided datasets. Include the theoretical run time as well as the profiled run time. Discuss the theoretical results vs. the real results. Discuss how changing the base case of the divide and conquer algorithm affects the run time, and why you might do this.
